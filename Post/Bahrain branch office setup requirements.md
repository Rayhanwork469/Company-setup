- **Parent Company documents legalized and translated**

## Branch Office vs. Subsidiary vs. Representative Office

![Branch office vs subsidiary diagram alt text: graphic showing differences between legal entities in Bahrain](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519337265831-281ec6cc8514?fit=crop&w=800&q=80 "Legal Entity Types - Unsplash")

**Branch Office:**  
Operates as an extension of the parent foreign company. Liabilities and activities are directly tied to the parent.

**Subsidiary:**  
A separate legal entity, usually a WLL (With Limited Liability) or SPC (Single Person Company) with local shareholding requirements. See [Bahrain Business Type Structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

**Representative Office:**  
Limited to liaison activities‚Äîcannot generate income or enter commercial contracts.

**Key Considerations:**
- Branch offices suit businesses wanting direct control but with parental liability.
- Subsidiaries suit those seeking local legal separation.
- Representative offices best fit pure marketing or research functions.

## Legal Requirements for Bahrain Branch Offices

Branch office formation in Bahrain is governed by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law (BCCL) and Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) regulations.

### Commercial Registration (CR)

Every branch must obtain a **Commercial Registration (CR)**‚Äîthis is the government‚Äôs core business license. CRs are granted for specific activities, and each activity may require additional ministry approval.
