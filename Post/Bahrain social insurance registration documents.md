## What is Bahrain Social Insurance? 🔑

The **Bahrain Social Insurance Organization (SIO)** is the government body overseeing pensions, social insurance, and workers’ welfare ([Official SIO Portal](https://www.sio.gov.bh)). Social insurance in Bahrain:

- Is *mandatory* for all employers and employees (Bahraini and expatriate).
- Covers *pension*, *work injury*, *unemployment*, *maternity*, and more.
- Is also available for self-employed individuals.

Social insurance contributions are calculated as a percentage of employees’ salaries, split between employer and employee ([KeyLinkBH: Accounting and Bookkeeping Services in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)).  
**Fun fact:** The SIO processed over 2.3 million transactions in 2024!
