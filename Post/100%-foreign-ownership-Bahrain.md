## What Does 100% Foreign Ownership Really Mean?

**100% foreign ownership** in Bahrain enables expatriates and international companies to own the entire share capital of their ventures‚Äî**no Bahraini partner required**. This is a game-changer for those used to the old model, where local sponsorship or shared equity was mandatory.

### Quick Answer for Featured Snippet üìã

> **100% foreign ownership in Bahrain** means that a foreign individual or company can establish and own the full stake in a Bahraini entity without the legal requirement to partner with a local. This offers full control over management, profits, and business decisions‚Äîa significant advantage over most other GCC countries.

The landmark legal shift came in **2016** when Bahrain amended its Commercial Companies Law (Decree Law No. 21 of 2001). The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) further expanded the list of activities eligible for full ownership in 2018 and 2019 ([Source](https://www.bahrain.com/)).

**Key Takeaways:**
- No minimum capital requirements for most sectors.
