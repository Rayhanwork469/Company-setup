A Bahrain SPC (Single Person Company) is a unique legal structure created to empower entrepreneurs and small business owners with full control and limited liability. In simple terms, it‚Äôs a one-person Limited Liability Company (LLC), allowing an individual‚ÄîBahraini or foreigner‚Äîto own and operate the business solely.

**Key Features:**
- **100% ownership** for nationals and eligible foreigners
- **Limited liability** protects your personal assets
- Operates as a separate legal entity
- Fast-tracked formation (often in less than 1 week)
- Accepted in most commercial, industrial, and professional activities

üìä *Did you know?* Over 9,000 SPCs have been registered in Bahrain since 2021 ([KeylinkBH](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)).
