## Who Needs an Audit in Bahrain?

![Auditor reviewing company financials in a modern office](https://images.pexels.com/photos/6693655/pexels-photo-6693655.jpeg?auto=compress&w=1000 "Audit process in Bahrain office")

### Legal Entities & Thresholds

Bahrain law distinguishes between several business typesâ€”each with unique audit obligations. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

- **WLL (With Limited Liability) & BSC Closed Companies:** *Audit required if annual revenue exceeds BHD 50,000 (approx. USD 132,500)*.
- **Public BSC & Larger Entities:** *Mandatory annual audits regardless of turnover*.
- **Single Person Companies:** *Audit required if annual turnover goes above BHD 50,000* ([KeyLink: Single Person Company](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)).
- **Branches of Foreign Companies:** *Audit required; report must be in line with parent company standards* ([KeyLink: Foreign Company Branch](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)).
- **Free Zone Entities:** *Audit commonly required for regulatory filing and business bank account opening* ([KeyLink: Free Zone in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/)).

> **Direct Answer:** *In Bahrain, companies exceeding BHD 50,000 in annual turnover, all public companies, and foreign branches must undergo an annual external audit by a licensed firm. Smaller WLLs and sole proprietorships are exemptâ€”unless they cross the threshold or need an audit for banking, licensing, or investor requirements.*

### Foreign-Owned & Free Zone Companies

Foreign investors often seek 100% or 99% ownership ([KeyLink: 99% Foreign Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), and regulatory bodies scrutinize compliance closely. Audits:

- Prove compliance for foreign enterprise and free zone licenses.
- Satisfy banks when opening business accounts ([KeyLink: Business & Corporate Bank Account](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/)).
- Facilitate smooth capital repatriation and cross-border transactions.

### Case Study: A Bahrain SME In Practice

**Zain Holdings** (fictionalized), a WLL company in Bahrain, crossed the BHD 50,000 threshold in its second year. The founders selected a reputable CPA firm, streamlined their accounting ([KeyLink: Accounting & Bookkeeping](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)), and used the audit report to secure a business loan for expansion.
