## Preparatory Steps Before Formation

Before jumping into paperwork, planning is your best friend.

### Evaluate Business Activities & Ownership Options

- **What will your business do?**  
  Bahrain regulates company activities via a comprehensive list of Commercial Registration (CR) activities. Some require special licenses. ([Bahrain CR activities detailed guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/))

- **Ownership structure:**  
   Thanks to Bahrain‚Äôs progressive rules, most sectors allow 100% foreign ownership ([foreigner-friendly activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)), but some may require local participation.

- **Consider Free Zones:**  
   Special Economic Zones offer added benefits. ([Bahrain Free Zone Guide](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/))

### Choosing the Right Structure

- **Capital needs**
- **Funding (public vs private)**

### Step 1: Name Reservation & Initial Registration

**What‚Äôs involved?**
- Submit 3-5 proposed names to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) for approval.

---

### Step 2: Drafting the Memorandum and Articles of Association

- **Legal Blueprint:** These foundational documents define the company‚Äôs purpose, governance, share capital, and more.
