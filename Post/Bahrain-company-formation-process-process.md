### Step 2: Select Business Structure and Ownership

- **LLC, SPC, Branch, or Free Zone?** ([compare structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/))
- **Ownership Split:** Determine if you want 100% foreign ownership, or if local partnership makes sense.
  - **Local Agent/Sponsor:** Only required in specific activities ([see local sponsorship guide](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

**Table: Quick Comparison of Bahrain Company Structures**
| Structure            | Foreign Ownership | Min. Shareholders | Corporate Tax | Ideal For            |

| Free Zone Co.        | 100%             | Varies            | 0%           | Trade, Logistics     |

*Ownership limits depend on licensed activity.

### Step 3: Reserve Company Name and Prepare Documents

- **Name Reservation:** Choose a unique, non-offensive name via the [Sijilat portal](https://www.sijilat.bh/).

  - Memorandum of Association ([MOA template](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/))
