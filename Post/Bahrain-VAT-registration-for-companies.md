**Value Added Tax (VAT)** is an indirect consumption tax imposed on goods and services at every stage of production and distribution. Ultimately, the final consumer bears the cost, but every business along the supply chain collects and remits VAT to the government.

### Key VAT Terms
- **Taxable Person**: Any individual or entity conducting business activities subject to VAT.
- **Input VAT**: VAT paid on purchases.
- **Output VAT**: VAT collected on sales.

**Why does VAT matter?**  
Itâ€™s a vital government revenue stream and signals that your business is legitimate and compliantâ€”a must for investors and partners.
