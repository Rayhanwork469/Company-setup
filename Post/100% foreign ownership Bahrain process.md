## Bahrain's Foreign Ownership Policy Explained

Bahrain’s foreign ownership regulations have taken a leap forward. As part of its Economic Vision 2030, the government now *allows non-GCC nationals to own 100% of companies* across a broad range of sectors, with only a few exceptions (primarily related to national security and limited commercial activities).

**Key points:**

- **Full Capital Repatriation:** Take profits home with no restrictions.
- **Zero Local Sponsorship:** You don’t need a Bahraini partner.
- **Wide Activity Range:** Finance, trading, services, and many industrial sectors are open.
