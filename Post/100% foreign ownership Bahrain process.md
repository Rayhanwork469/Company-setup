## Bahrain's Foreign Ownership Policy Explained

Bahrain‚Äôs foreign ownership regulations have taken a leap forward.

**Key points:**

- **Full Capital Repatriation:** Take profits home with no restrictions.
- **Zero Local Sponsorship:** You don‚Äôt need a Bahraini partner.
- **Wide Activity Range:** Finance, trading, services, and many industrial sectors are open.
