Here’s your roadmap—from concept to “open for business.”

### 1. Business Type Structures 

Bahrain offers several company structures, each with distinct requirements ([Business Structures Overview](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)):

| Company Type                  | Foreign Ownership | Ideal For                    | Min. Shareholders | Local Sponsor Needed? |
|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|

### 2. Choosing Your Business Activity 

Not all activities are open to 100% foreign ownership. Review the [CR Activities List](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/) for permitted sectors. Popular options:
- IT and digital services
- General trading/import-export
- Consultancy
- Manufacturing (in free zones)

**Tip:**  
Check [Foreigner-Friendly Activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) for ready reference!

### 3. Commercial Registration (CR) Online 

![Digital Registration Image](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181325/pexalt="Entrepreneur registering a business online in Bahrain"*

Your company’s “birth certificate,” obtained through the Sijilat portal ([Commercial Registration Guide](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)). 

**What You’ll Need:**
- Passport copies (shareholders/directors)
- Proposed business name
- Address in Bahrain (virtual office allowed for many startups)
- Initial capital declaration (amount varies by activity)
- Memorandum of Association ([MOA Explained](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/))

Online consultants streamline document prep, translation, and submission.

### 4. Memorandum of Association 

An MOA outlines your company’s legal purpose, structure, and ownership ([MOA Details](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/)). E-signatures are now accepted, thanks to Bahrain’s advanced eSignature infrastructure.

### 5. Bank Account Opening 

![Business Banking Image](https://images.pexels.com/photos/164527/pex="Bahrain business owner opening a corporate bank account online"*

After securing your CR, you’ll need a Bahrain-based business bank account ([Bank Account Setup](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/)). 

**Required Documents:**
- CR certificate
- MOA
- Shareholder and director IDs
- Proof of Bahrain address

Many local and international banks now process applications remotely, with online KYC verification.

### 6. Visas & Permits 

If you intend to work or live in Bahrain, you’ll need the appropriate visa ([Professional Visa Consultants](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/)). Consultancies offer end-to-end visa processing, covering:
- Investor visas
- Employee visas
- Dependent visas for family

### 7. Accounting & Bookkeeping 

Bahrain mandates proper accounting and annual audits ([Accounting & Bookkeeping Services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)). Many online consultants bundle affordable bookkeeping and tax services into their setup packages. 

**Don’t Skip:**  
Proper accounting shields you from compliance risk and makes annual returns a breeze.
