## Step-by-Step: How to Register a Company in Bahrain 📝

Bahrain’s digital-first approach means you can handle much of the process online, saving precious time and avoiding bureaucracy.

### Eligibility and Ownership for Foreigners 🌐 

Most businesses—which include commercial, professional, and industrial activities—allow 100% foreign ownership ([Details](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)). Sectors like oil and media may have restrictions.

- GCC nationals: Same rights as Bahrainis.
- Non-GCC (e.g., UK, US, India): Enjoy generous ownership allowances.
- Find the full eligible activities list: [Bahrain CR Activities](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/).

### Choose the Right Business Activity 💼 
Each commercial registration (CR) must state the intended business activity. Multiple activities are allowed, but each may have different license requirements.

- IT, trading, consulting? 100% foreigner-friendly.
- Healthcare, media, or defense? Can be restricted.

This process is quick: many business registrations are approved in 10-15 working days for standard sectors.

**See the official guide and timeline [here](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/).**

### Company Name and Commercial Registration 🏷️ 
- Names must be unique, not offensive, and compliant with Bahrain’s commercial law.
