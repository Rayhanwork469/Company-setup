**Direct Answer (100‚Äì120 words):**  
To register a company in Bahrain, entrepreneurs must submit their ID/passport (all shareholders), proof of address, a proposed company name, draft Memorandum and Articles of Association, Board Resolution (if a corporate shareholder), lease agreement or proof of office address, and sector-specific licenses (if applicable). Foreign investors may need to legalize and notarize certain documents at the Bahrain embassy and submit a bank reference letter or CV. The full set depends on the company type, nationality of owners, and business sector. Accuracy, notarization, and translation into Arabic (if needed) are essential for approval ([source](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/)).
