### 5.1 Choosing Your Business Activity 

Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) lists hundreds of business activities—each with licensing, capital, and ownership rules. 

**Pro tip:** Some activities, like trading or consultancy, support 100% foreign ownership. Others require a local partner.

- **See the full list of CR activities:** [Bahrain CR activities](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)
- Interactive: *Which sector are you interested in?*  
  - Poll: [ ] Tech   [ ] Trading   [ ] Food&Beverage   [ ] Consulting   [ ] Other (Comment below!)

### 5.2 Naming and Reserving Your Company 

Your company name must be unique and not infringe upon reserved or trademarked names.  
- Submit 3–5 name options via the [Sijilat portal](https://www.moic.gov.bh).
- Names can be in English or Arabic.
- Use of “Bahrain” or “Gulf” may require special permission.

**Expert tip:** Always check the [memorandum requirements](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/) before finalizing your name.

### 5.3 Commercial Registration (CR) Explained 

CR is your golden ticket—it’s the official license to operate.  
- Submit required info (owner details, passport, address, activity).
- Pay CR fees (BHD 100–350, depending on activity).
- Approval in as little as 3–7 working days for standard sectors.

- Use a professional service to avoid mistakes ([recommended consultants](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/)).

### 5.5 Opening a Business Bank Account 

Banks in Bahrain are strict on compliance (AML/CFT), so you’ll need:
- CR certificate
- MOA/Articles
- Shareholder IDs/passports
- Address/proof of business

Recommended banks: Bank ABC, Ahli United, HSBC Bahrain.  
**Banking guide:** [Business corporate bank account in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/)

### 5.6 Work Permits, Visas, and Labor Law 

- Expat founders/employees require work visas, processed via LMRA (Labor Market Regulatory Authority).
- Minimum wage and Bahraini quota rules apply (some exceptions for startups).
- **For professional help:** [Visa consultants in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/)

### 5.7 Free Zones, 100% Ownership, and Sponsorship 

- Many sectors in Bahrain allow up to 100% foreign ownership—compare with UAE or Saudi.
- Special free zones offer even greater flexibility for logistics, fintech, and manufacturing.
- Some activities (legal, real estate) still require a [local sponsor](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/).

## Case Study: Tech Startup Launch in Bahrain (2024) 

In 2024, "MobixLab," a fintech app developer from India, chose Bahrain over Dubai for three reasons:
- 100% foreign ownership in IT
- Lower government and rental fees
- Access to Gulf investment funds via local accelerators

**Timeline:**  
MobixLab submitted its company name, got CR in 4 days, and banked with ABC Bahrain in under a week. Founders obtained two-year work visas using an [expert visa consultant](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/), registered for VAT, and participated in a government-backed innovation grant program.

**Key Outcome:**  
Growth from 2 to 12 staff in the first year—serving Saudi clients with local presence.
