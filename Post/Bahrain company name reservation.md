- **Mandated by Bahrain‚Äôs Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC)**
- Name reservation is a prerequisite for commercial registration ([CR](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)) and company incorporation
- Applies to all business types (LLC, SPC, branch, etc.)

## The Benefits of Reserving Your Company Name Early

You might wonder: *Why not wait until I‚Äôm ready to open my doors?* Reserving your name upfront offers real tactical advantages:

- **Exclusivity:** Prevents competitors (or copycats) from taking your chosen name
- **Peace of Mind:** Gives you time to handle other paperwork, secure funding, or build your brand knowing your name is safe
- **Investor Confidence:** A reserved name signals seriousness to potential partners or investors
- **Marketing Prep:** Lets you start designing logos, registering domains, and ordering signage early

**Case in Point:**  
*In 2023, a Bahrain fintech startup lost weeks of planning because its desired name was taken by a rival that reserved it first. Early preparation is a smart defensive move!*
