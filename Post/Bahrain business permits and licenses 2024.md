## Types of Business Permits and Licenses in Bahrain 🏷️ 

There’s no “one size fits all” when it comes to business authorization in Bahrain. Picking the right structure and license type impacts your operations, profitability, and even your visa eligibility.

### Commercial Registration (CR): Your Gateway Permit 

The **Commercial Registration** (CR) is the main business license issued by Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT). Without it, you simply cannot operate legally.

**Key Facts:**  
- Required for ALL business activities (trade, services, consultancy, manufacturing, etc.)
- Multiple activities can be declared under one CR
- CR type depends on ownership, business structure, and activity
- Foreigners can now own up to 100% in most activities ([More on foreigner-friendly activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/))

#### Main Business Structures for CR

- **Single Person Company (SPC)**
