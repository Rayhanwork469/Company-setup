## Step-by-Step Guide: Bahrain Business License Process

### 1. Reserve Your Company Name 📝

Start with reserving your trade name through MOICT’s Sijilat portal. The name should comply with Bahrain’s naming conventions and not clash with existing companies. Most approvals land in 1-2 working days.

### 2. Prepare Foundational Documents

Draft and notarize your Memorandum of Association. For foreign shareholders, documents may need legalization via the Bahrain embassy in your home country.

*Tip: Consult a [professional incorporation expert](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/) to ensure airtight documentation.*

### 3. Submit Your Application

Upload your documents using the Sijilat system: [Commercial Registration](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/) is a fully digital process. You’ll choose your activity, define shareholders, and attach support papers.

### 4. Regulatory Approvals & Fees

If your business falls under special regulation (e.g., finance, health), extra approvals apply. Pay the license fees online. See [Bahrain company formation costs](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/) for current rates.

### 5. Collect Your Commercial Registration (CR)

Once greenlit, you receive the CR certificate and your official license. This opens the door to contracts, invoicing, visas, and banking.

### 6. Post-License Steps: Opening Bank Accounts & Visas

Set up a [corporate bank account](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/), register for VAT if eligible, and apply for work visas ([professional visa consultants](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/) can help). [Accounting services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) ensure you stay compliant.

## Foreign Ownership in Bahrain: What You Need to Know
