Reserving your company name is the first official checkpoint. It’s not just a formality—your choice becomes your legal identity, anchors your brand, and is vital for every CR-related step ([see commercial registration process](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)). Here’s why you should care:

- **Legal Protection:** Prevents others from copying or using your name.
- **Brand Value:** Shapes perception and trust among customers.
- **Operational Prerequisite:** Needed for MOICT applications and business bank accounts ([how to open a business bank account](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/)).
- **Foreign Investment Compliance:** Required for 100% foreign ownership and Free Zone setup ([read about Free Zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/)).

Ignoring these steps can stall your business dreams before they start.
