### Step 4: Obtain Your Commercial Registration (CR) 🎫

Upon successful review, you’ll be granted a CR number—this is your company’s official business ID.

- Use your virtual office address for CR ([see latest rules](https://keylinkbh.com/setting-up-a-company-in-bahrain/))
- Some activities require pre-approval or sector-specific licenses (e.g., fintech, education)

**Tip:** If you’re eyeing a [free zone in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/), confirm if your virtual office provider is located within eligible free zones.

### Step 5: Set Up Essential Business Services 🛠️

Recommended services include:
- Accounting & Bookkeeping ([trusted providers](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/))

## Key Considerations & Common Challenges

Despite all the perks, entrepreneurs often face a few roadblocks:

1. **Office Address Restrictions:** Certain sectors still require a physical office, not just a virtual one.
2. **Bank Account Setups:** Some banks may require physical office proof for high-risk or regulated activities.
3. **Licensing Variations:** Rules shift based on business activity—always double-check with [reputable company formation advisors](https://keylinkbh.com/starting-a-business-in-bahrain/).

**Quick Tip:** Plan ahead for annual renewals and regulatory filings to avoid fines or business interruptions.
