## What is a Single Person Company (SPC)? ü§î

A **Single Person Company (SPC)** is a legal business entity owned entirely by a single individual. Bahrain introduced SPC regulations to encourage entrepreneurship by simplifying company formation and offering limited liability protection. Unlike traditional sole proprietorships, an SPC is recognized as a separate legal entity, meaning your personal assets are shielded from business liabilities.

### Key Features of an SPC:
- **100% Ownership:** The owner holds full control without needing partners or shareholders.
- **Separate Legal Status:** SPC has its own legal identity, distinct from the owner.
- **Limited Liability:** Owner‚Äôs liability limited to the capital invested.
- **Flexibility:** Suitable for various business activities approved by Bahrain‚Äôs commercial regulations.

### Highlights of the Legal Framework:
- **One shareholder allowed:** Individual ownership is mandatory.
