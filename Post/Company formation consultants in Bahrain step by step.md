**Consultant’s Role:**  
They will assess your business goals, risk appetite, and capital requirements to recommend the best fit.

### Step 3: Deciding on 100% Foreign Ownership or Local Sponsorship

**Liberal Ownership Laws:**  
Bahrain has pioneered foreign ownership reforms, allowing:
- 100% foreign ownership in most sectors.
- 99% foreign ownership in others.

*Explore the [updated list of 100% foreign-ownership activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) and details on [99% foreign ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/).*

**When is local sponsorship required?**  
Some sectors—like certain trading or commercial activities—may require a Bahraini partner or agent.

**Table: Activities and Ownership Rules**

| Activity Type         | 100% Foreign Ownership | Local Sponsorship |
|----------------------|:----------------------:|:----------------:|
| IT/Consulting        | ✔️                    | ❌              |

   Your trade name must not conflict with existing companies and needs prior approval.
