## FAQ

### 1. How easy is it for a foreigner to start a company in Bahrain?
Bahrain offers one of the smoothest pathways—most business activities permit 100% foreign ownership, no local partner required.

Yes, but the list is shrinking. Over 400+ activities now support full foreign ownership, spanning trading, consulting, tech, manufacturing, and more. Certain sensitive sectors (like non-financial local trade) may still require a local shareholding component. Check the latest list [here](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/).

### 4. Do I need a Bahraini partner or local sponsor for my business?
Not in most cases. Bahrain’s landmark reforms mean you can open a business with full foreign ownership in most commercial and professional zones. For activities that do require a local sponsor, specialized [sponsorship options](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/) exist.

### 5. Can I relocate and get residency if I open a company?
