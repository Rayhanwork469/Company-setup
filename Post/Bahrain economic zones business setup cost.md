## Introduction: Why Bahrain? 🌍

Bahrain, the pearl of the Gulf, has carved a niche as a launchpad for businesses seeking access to the GCC, MENA, and global markets. Foreign investors are increasingly drawn to its economic zones for simple company setup, streamlined regulation, strong legal protections, and, crucially, cost efficiency.

If you’re weighing your options in the region—whether you’re a startup, a tech company, a logistics giant, or an SME—understanding the full cost of launching in Bahrain’s economic zones is absolutely essential. Let’s break down exactly what you’ll spend and what you’ll get back.
