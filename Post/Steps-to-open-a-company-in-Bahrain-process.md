## Step 1: Decide on Your Business Activity 🎯

Before anything else, identify your **business activity** because Bahrain’s licensing authority categorizes businesses to regulate them accordingly.

### Why is this critical?
- Determines what licenses you need.
- Affects ownership rules.
- Influences document requirements.

Business activities range from commercial trading, industrial manufacturing, consultancy, to financial services. You can check approved activities on the Bahrain Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) website or via [Bahrain CR Activities](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/).

> **Pro Tip:** Choose your business activity carefully to avoid delays or legal challenges later.

## Step 2: Choose the Right Legal Structure ⚖️

Now that you know your business activity, it’s time to pick the business structure that fits your vision, whether a Limited Liability Company, Single Person Company, or a branch of a foreign company.

- **LLC:** Ideal for partnerships & SMEs; you need a local sponsor or partner unless your activity is 100% foreign ownership-permitted.
- **SPC:** Perfect for solo entrepreneurs seeking full control with limited liability.
- **Foreign Branch:** If you have a parent company overseas and want direct market presence.

Each has different setup costs, compliance, and tax implications. For expert help, see [Company Incorporation in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/).

## Step 3: Reserve Your Commercial Registration (CR) 📝

The commercial registration is your official business license and proof of legal existence.

### Process:
1. Submit an application to MOIC.
2. Provide proposed company name (subject to approval).
3. Specify business activity.
4. Pay associated fees.

You can reserve your CR online via the Bahrain eGovernment portal.

The MOA is the letter of intent, defining company objectives, shareholder contributions, and governance.

### What does it include?
- Company name
- Business purpose
- Share capital details
- Shareholders’ names and stakes
- Management structure

Once drafted, MOA must be notarized by a Bahraini notary and submitted to obtain final approval.
