## Why Expats Choose Bahrain for Business

### The Attractiveness of 100% Foreign Ownership

Gone are the days when foreign investors needed a Bahraini partner for most business activities. Thanks to sweeping reforms ([Keylink: 100% Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)), expats can enjoy almost full ownership in most sectors:

- 🇧🇭 No local sponsor required for many business categories
- 100% ownership for WLLs, SPCs, and certain branches ([Keylink: 99% Foreign Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/))
- Streamlined government processes

**Expert Insight:**  
*"Bahrain's move to allow 100% foreign ownership across most sectors is a game-changer, leveling the playing field with regional hubs like Dubai and Doha."*  
— Gulf Business Review, 2024

### Tax Advantages & Business Climate

- **No personal income tax, no capital gains tax, and zero corporate tax** on most business types ([Bahrain.com](https://www.bahrain.com/))
- Only VAT at 5–10% (2025, depending on product/service)
- A strategic Gulf location with direct market access to GCC
- World-class digital infrastructure, affordable office space, and a skilled multicultural workforce
