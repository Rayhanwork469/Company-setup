## Business Landscape Overview: Bahrain vs Oman

*Alt: Manama skyline with iconic buildings, reflecting Bahrain‚Äôs economic dynamism.*

### Bahrain at a Glance
- **Population:** 1.8 million (World Bank, 2024)
- **GDP Growth:** 3.3% (IMF, 2024)
- **Global Business Ranking:** Top 35 (World Bank, 2024)

Bahrain is often called the startup capital of the Gulf. With liberal ownership rules, zero corporate tax for most businesses, and an efficient, digital-friendly registration process, it‚Äôs a magnet for international founders. Proximity to Saudi Arabia boosts trade and logistics advantages.

### Oman in Focus
- **Population:** 4.7 million (World Bank, 2024)
- **GDP Growth:** 2.7% (IMF, 2024)
- **Ease of Doing Business:** Improving, mid-tier in GCC (World Bank, 2024)

Oman is growing fast, especially in logistics, energy, tourism, and tech. Local ownership rules still apply outside free zones, but new regulations are opening doors for full foreign participation. Stable politics, growing infrastructure, and large-scale development projects are drawing more multinational investment.
