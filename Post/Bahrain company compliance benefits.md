## What is Company Compliance in Bahrain?

Company compliance means following all legal, financial, and operational rules set by Bahrain‚Äôs authorities, such as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), and the Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA).

**Common compliance areas include:**
- Company registration
- Business licensing
- Tax reporting and payments
- Regulatory filings
- Labor and immigration rules
- Anti-money laundering (AML)

Miss a requirement, and you risk more than fines ‚Äî you could lose your license, face criminal charges, or damage hard-won investor trust.

**Example Penalties üìâ:**
| Violation        | Potential Fine      | Impact                         |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Failure to file annual returns | BHD 500‚Äì1,000+ | License suspension            |
