## Step-by-Step: How to Register a Company in Muharraq

Let’s demystify the process! Here’s your roadmap, with expert insider tips along the way.

### 1. Define Your Business Activity

Picking the right activity shapes your license, regulatory needs, and CR code ([activity list](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)). Consulting with a local expert can ensure your activity matches your goals and is allowed for foreigners.

### 2. Choose a Company Structure

Refer to the table above, or let your consultancy advise based on capital, partners, and liability preferences.

### 3. Reserve a Unique Company Name

Names must be distinctive, meaningful, and not infringe trademarks.

### 4. Prepare Required Documents

Typically includes:
- Passport copies of shareholders/directors
- Proof of address
- Memorandum of Association ([full guide](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/))
- Articles of Association
- Business plan (sometimes required for foreign applicants)

### 5. Submit Application via Sijilat Portal

All business registrations go through the government [Sijilat](https://www.sijilat.bh/) platform, overseen by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT). Consultancies can manage the entire digital submission.

### 6. Obtain Approvals & Commercial Registration (CR)

Certain sectors need extra clearances (e.g., health, education, financial services).

### 7. Open a Business Bank Account

A critical step. Check our [corporate banking setup guide](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/).

### 8. Register for Taxes & Labor Fund

Bahrain has zero corporate tax in most cases, but you must register with authorities for VAT (if applicable) and labor support.

### 9. Secure Visas and Work Permits

Muharraq consultancies can also assist with [professional visa procurement](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/).

### 10. Post-Registration Compliance

You’ll need a business address, annual filing, and may require licenses renewals. Outsource to [local accounting services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) to stay stress-free.
