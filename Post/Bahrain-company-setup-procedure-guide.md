- **With Limited Liability (WLL):** Ideal for small-to-medium businesses, minimum two shareholders, limited liability.

## Step-by-Step: Bahrain Company Formation Procedure

### Initial Planning & Business Activity Selection

Begin by pinpointing your business activity – everything flows from this. Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) keeps a clear list of permitted [CR activities](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/).

- **Research demand, competition, and regulations** for your desired sector.
- Check which activities allow full foreign ownership ([see the list](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)).
- Define your service/product scope and target customers.

> **Featured Snippet Answer:**  
> To start a company in Bahrain, identify your intended business activity, ensure it’s permitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and confirm eligibility for foreign ownership. Choose a business structure, secure a company name, and prepare the relevant documentation before registering your business.

3. **Pay Fees**  
   - Expect BHD 50–100 for name reservation and registration.

Depending on your activity, extra government permissions or licenses might be needed (especially for food, health, education, fintech, or real estate).

- Ministry of Health for clinics
- Central Bank of Bahrain for financial institutions

- **Investor/owner visa:** Tied to company founders.
- **Employee visas:** For approved job roles within your company structure.
- **Family/resident visas:** For dependents.

Turn to [professional visa consultants in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/) for a smooth process.

### Office Space and Local Sponsorship

**Physical presence:** Some business activities require a physical office lease. Co-working spaces, serviced offices, or virtual setups are available (especially for startups).

**Local sponsorship:** Most structures, especially in mainland sectors, *do not* require a Bahraini partner for majority ownership, a unique pro. When needed (e.g., very limited protected activities), detailed info is available at [local sponsorship in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/).

### Accounting, Bookkeeping, and Compliance

- Maintain accounting records for at least five years.
- File annual returns; VAT registration is mandatory for qualifying firms.
