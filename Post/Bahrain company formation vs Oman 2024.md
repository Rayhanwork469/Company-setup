As per [Gulf News](https://www.gulfnews.com/uae/bahrain), the nation has aggressively invested in digital infrastructure, making it a fintech powerhouse.

**Highlights:**
- **Pro-business reforms:** Rapid licensing, minimal red tape, e-government services

Yes, Bahrain enables 100% foreign ownership in nearly all sectors ([see allowed activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)), without a mandatory local sponsor.

### 2. What are the main differences in company formation costs?

Bahrain‚Äôs setup costs are among the lowest in the GCC ([detailed cost guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/)). Oman's costs are much higher due to bigger minimum capital and government fees, making Bahrain more accessible for small businesses and startups.

Bahrain features accelerators, grants, and startup-friendly regulations ([see support programs](https://keylinkbh.com/starting-a-business-in-bahrain/)), including Tamkeen and StartUp Bahrain.

---

### 4. Is company liquidation easier in Bahrain or Oman?

Bahrain‚Äôs company liquidation process is transparent and relatively quick ([read more](https://keylinkbh.com/company-liquidation-in-bahrain/)). Oman‚Äôs process can involve more government departments and longer timelines, especially for LLCs.
