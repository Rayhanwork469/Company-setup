*Alt: Icons representing various business structures in Bahrain: WLL, SPC, branch, partnership.*

Choosing the right company structure impacts compliance, liability, tax, and scalability. Here are the main business types to consider:

| Business Structure        | Foreign Ownership | Minimum Capital  | Suitable For                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| With Limited Liability (WLL) | Up to 100% (sector-based) | BD 20,000 ($53,000) | Most trading, services, tech startups         |
| Single Person Company (SPC)  | 100%              | BD 50 ($132)         | Freelancers, single-owner startups            |
| Branch of Foreign Company    | 100%              | None                 | Extension of existing foreign parent company  |
| Partnership Company          | Up to 99%         | BD 20,000+           | Professional services, consultancies          |
| Public Shareholding Company  | 49%-100% (sector-specific) | BD 1,000,000+       | Large, high-capital ventures                  |
