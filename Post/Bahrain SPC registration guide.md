## What Is an SPC? Understanding the Structure

An SPC, or Single Person Company, is a legal entity owned by one individual, offering limited liability protection while letting the founder retain full control. Unlike partnerships or joint ventures, this structure doesn’t require multiple shareholders. SPCs are perfect for solo entrepreneurs, consultants, freelancers, and digital businesses.

**Key Features of Bahrain SPCs:**

- **One owner**: Individual ownership, with full management authority
- **Limited liability**: Personal assets are protected from company debts or lawsuits
- **Separate legal person**: The SPC is a distinct legal entity
- **Flexible business activities**: Trade, professional services, consultancy, tech startups, and more
