## Key Steps To Registering a Company in Bahrain

### Step 1: Choose the Right Company Structure

![Entrepreneur reviewing company structure flowchart](https://images.pexels.com/photos/669619/pexels-photo-669619.jpeg?auto=compress&w=1000)
*Alt text: Entrepreneur examining company structure flowchart.*

The foundation of your business begins with legal form. Bahrain recognizes several business types:
- **With Limited Liability (W.L.L)**
- **Single Person Company (SPC)**
- **Branch of Foreign Company**
- **Bahrain Shareholding Company**
- **General or Limited Partnership**
- **Professional Firm**

**Key questions to consider:**
- Will you work alone, or with partners?
- Is 100% foreign ownership vital for you?
- Do you need a local sponsor? ([see more](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/))
- Will you operate in a free zone or mainland? ([read about business type structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/))

For most foreign entrepreneurs, a **W.L.L or SPC** is the go-to, as it offers flexibility and clear ownership rules. Learn more about company formation costs [here](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

- Uniqueness in Bahrain’s registry
- Compliance with naming conventions
- No offensive or restricted terms

**Tip:** Prepare at least three name options to avoid delays.

1. Enter company data (structure, activities, shareholders)
2. Upload scanned documents
3. Choose business activities ([see allowed activities for 100% foreign ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/))

*Alt text: Approved official certificate for business activity.*

Certain business activities (e.g., financial services, health, education) require extra regulatory approvals. The portal routes your application to relevant ministries and notifies you of missing items.

- Ministry of Health, Central Bank, or other regulators may review
- Expect requests for interviews for sensitive sectors
- Once cleared, main Commercial Registration (CR) is issued

**Don’t forget:** Licensing requirements vary by sector ([detailed activity list](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)).

### Step 6: Finalize Incorporation & Get Your CR
