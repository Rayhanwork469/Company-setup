## Key Factors Influencing Company Setup Cost

Setting up a business isn‚Äôt ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù Costs vary, and knowing your options means you can tailor your structure and expenses from day one.

### Company Type and Structure

Every Bahraini business starts with picking a legal structure:
- **With Partners (WLL / LLC)**
- **Single Person Company (SPC)**
- **Foreign Branch Office**
- **Public or Private Joint Stock Company**
- **Professional Firms**

Each type has a unique registration process, capital requirement, and cost. Discover the differences here: [Bahrain Business Type Structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

**Pro Tip:** Many SMEs start as SPCs for simplicity and full control. Larger firms often choose WLL for limited liability protection.
