*alt: Bahrain skyline with business towers at dusk*

Bahrain shines as a commercial hub in the GCC for several reasons:

- **100% Foreign Ownership**: Unlike its neighbors, Bahrain allows majority or full foreign ownership for many activities ([see 99% Foreign Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), making it ideal for non-GCC founders.
- **Ease of Doing Business**: Ranked among the region‚Äôs top countries for business by the World Bank, with streamlined government processes ([Gulf News](https://www.gulfnews.com/uae/bahrain)).
- **No Corporate or Income Tax**: Most companies pay zero corporate and income taxes, except for oil, gas, or petrochemical sectors.
- **Low Setup Costs**: Compared to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain‚Äôs overheads are appealingly moderate.
- **FinTech & Startup Friendly**: Special zones, modern regulations, and a thriving support ecosystem.
- **Strategic Location**: Perfect gateway to GCC and MENA markets.

Bahrain‚Äôs flexibility, regulatory support, and affordability have attracted global companies, ambitious startups, and SMEs alike. But how much will it *really* cost to set up and run your business here? Let‚Äôs break it down by the numbers.
