## Key Steps to Start a Business in Bahrain üèÅ

### 1. Choosing Your Business Structure

![Choosing Business Structure](https://images.pexels.com/photos/669365/pexels-photo-669365.jpeg?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80 "Entrepreneurs Discussing Company Types")

Selecting the right business type impacts your liability, tax, and operational freedom.

| Business Structure             | Features                                 | Foreign Ownership      | Link                                                         |
|------------------------------- |------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| W.L.L (With Limited Liability)| Max flexibility, min 2 shareholders      | Up to 100%            | [Company Formation in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/) |
| S.P.C (Single Person Company) | Simple, ideal for solo founders           | 100% allowed          | [Single Person Company](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)    |
| S.P (Sole Proprietorship)     | Full control, unlimited liability         | 100% allowed (select) | [Bahrain Business Type Structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) |
| Branch of Foreign Company     | Expand international brands               | 100% allowed          | [Foreign Company Branch](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)  |

**Pro tip:** Choose based on your funding, team, and sector ([read more](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)).

### 2. Registering Your Business (Commercial Registration)

![Registering Business in Bahrain](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184291/pexels-photo-3184291.jpeg?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80 "Business Registration Office")

To operate legally, you‚Äôll need a Commercial Registration (CR). This is your business‚Äôs government ID.

**Steps:**
1. Pick your business name (English/Arabic, must not exist).
2. Draft Memorandum of Association ([template](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/)).
3. Submit application with required KYC and documents ([see official CR guide](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)).
4. Obtain activity-specific licenses ([Bahrain CR Activities](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)).
5. Register for tax and labor (LMRA).

Foreign investors enjoy up to 100% ownership in most sectors. Some regulated sectors still require a local partner (Bahraini sponsor)‚Äîbut the list is shrinking as Bahrain pursues economic diversification.

- **Check permitted 100% ownership activities** ([details](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/))
- **99% foreign ownership** for others ([source](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/))
