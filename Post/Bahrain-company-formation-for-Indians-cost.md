## Introduction: Why Bahrain Attracts Indian Entrepreneurs 🇧🇭🇮🇳

Bahrain has quietly risen as a hotspot for Indian entrepreneurs looking for global growth. With its business-friendly climate, strategic Gulf location, and a legal structure welcoming foreign investment, thousands of Indians are exploring company formation here each year. If you’re considering setting up shop in Bahrain, you’re probably wondering: **How much will it cost? Which company structure fits my goals? What’s the process—simple or complicated?**

You’re not alone.

Still, the cost can fluctuate depending on your company type, size, and sector.

*Let’s break it all down, step-by-step, so you can confidently plan your Bahrain business journey!*
