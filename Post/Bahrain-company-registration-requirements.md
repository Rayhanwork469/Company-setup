### WLL (With Limited Liability)

A With Limited Liability company (WLL) is Bahrain’s go-to structure for most SMEs. It’s flexible, allows up to 100% foreign ownership for eligible activities, and offers protection to shareholders. Minimum two shareholders are required.

**Read more:** [Company formation in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/)

---

### SPC (Single Person Company)

A game-changer for solo founders: the SPC allows one individual to own the business outright, with limited liability protection. It’s perfect for consultants or freelancers who want to formalize their operations.

**Explore:** [SPC company setup in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)

---

### Foreign Branch

If you’re expanding your overseas company into Bahrain, the branch route is for you. You’ll need a local agent or sponsor, but you won’t have to incorporate a whole new legal entity. Fast, simple, and ideal for established brands.

**Learn more:** [Foreign company branch in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)

### Partnership Company, Joint Stock Company, and More

Larger companies—especially in financial services, construction, or multi-stakeholder ventures—often choose joint stock or partnership structures. These require more formalities and (occasionally) a local partner.

Ready to start your business journey? Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of the registration process, tailored for both expats and locals.

#### 1. **Choose Your Business Activity**

The first step: selecting your business activity. Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) maintains an updated list of permissible activities. Some activities (like law or medicine) have extra licensing steps.

**Tools:** [Bahrain CR Activities List](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)

#### 2. **Select the Right Legal Structure**

Refer to the table above and decide on WLL, SPC, Branch, etc.

#### 3. **Reserve Trade Name & Obtain Pre-Approvals**

Register your company name online via the Sijilat portal. Sensitive words or duplicates aren’t allowed.

#### 4. **Prepare Required Documents**

See our detailed checklist below.

#### 5. **Draft the MOA & AOA**

Make sure you include all the MOICT-required clauses for Memorandum of Association (MOA) and, if applicable, Articles of Association (AOA).

#### 6. **Submit Application & Pay Fees**

All documents are submitted via Sijilat or a licensed agent ([company incorporation in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/)).

#### 7. **Receive Commercial Registration (CR) Certificate**

Once approved, your CR is issued—your license to trade.

#### 8. **Apply for Business Visas (if needed)**

Set up residence visas for shareholders, directors, and employees ([professional visa consultants in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/)).

#### 9. **Open Local Bank Account**

See dedicated section below.

#### 10. **Register for Tax, Social Insurance & Other Compliance**

Certain activities also require VAT registration (if turnover exceeds threshold), social insurance, and municipal approvals.
