## Audit Requirements Overview for Bahrain Companies

### **What Are the Basic Audit Requirements in Bahrain? (Featured Snippet Section)**

**Quick Answer (120 words):**  
In Bahrain, most companies—especially WLLs (With Limited Liability), BSCs (Bahrain Shareholding Companies), and foreign branches—are legally required to have their annual financial statements audited by a licensed external auditor. Auditors must be independent and approved by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT). Audited financial statements must comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and be submitted annually, typically within three months after the financial year-end. Certain micro-enterprises and single-person companies may be exempt from mandatory audits, but full compliance is always recommended for credibility and banking purposes. Non-compliance can result in penalties, fines, and even suspension of commercial registration.
