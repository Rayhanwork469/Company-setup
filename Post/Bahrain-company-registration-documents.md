## Key Types of Business Structures in Bahrain

Choosing the right legal structure affects everything: your liability, tax obligations, ownership flexibility, and of course, the documents you will need. Bahrain offers several company types tailored to different needs:

### 1. Limited Liability Company (LLC)  
The most popular structure, especially for SMEs. Allows flexibility but requires a local partner for majority ownership unless under specific regimes.

### 2. Branch of a Foreign Company  
Foreign companies can open a branch office and operate under their parent company's name.

### 3. Single Person Company (SPC)  
Allows sole entrepreneurs to enjoy limited liability protections.

### 4. Free Zone Companies  
These entities benefit from 100% foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and streamlined registration. See [free zone in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/) for more.

### 5. Public Shareholding Company  
Suitable for large-scale enterprises aiming to list on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.
