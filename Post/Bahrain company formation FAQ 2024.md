*(See [Keylink: Business Type Structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) for detailed breakdown.)*

### WLL (With Limited Liability)
The Bahraini WLL is equivalent to an LLC (Limited Liability Company) and is the most common structure for startups and SMEs. It shields owners from personal liability and offers full foreign ownership in many activities ([100% Foreign Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)). Minimum capital requirements and allowed activities are regulated by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism.

### Single Person Company
Perfect for solo entrepreneurs who want full control. The Single Person Company (SPC) allows you to own, manage, and profit from your business as a single shareholder ([Keylink: Single Person Company in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)).

### Foreign Company Branch
Global companies can create a branch in Bahrain to serve local clients or expand into the Gulf ([Foreign Company Branch](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)). Parent companies remain fully responsible for branch liabilities.

### Free Zone Companies
Bahrain’s free zones offer tax breaks, international warehousing, and customs exemptions—ideal for logistics, e-commerce, and export-driven businesses ([Free Zone in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/)).
