It shields owners from personal liability and offers full foreign ownership in many activities ([100% Foreign Ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)). Minimum capital requirements and allowed activities are regulated by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism.

### Single Person Company
Perfect for solo entrepreneurs who want full control. The Single Person Company (SPC) allows you to own, manage, and profit from your business as a single shareholder ([Keylink: Single Person Company in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)).

### Foreign Company Branch
Global companies can create a branch in Bahrain to serve local clients or expand into the Gulf ([Foreign Company Branch](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)). Parent companies remain fully responsible for branch liabilities.

### Free Zone Companies
Bahrain‚Äôs free zones offer tax breaks, international warehousing, and customs exemptions‚Äîideal for logistics, e-commerce, and export-driven businesses ([Free Zone in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/)).
