- Access to GCC markets—Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar—via robust trade agreements
- Streamlined company registration (often completed in under 10 days)
- Competitive costs relative to Dubai, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia
- Strong English proficiency, excellent infrastructure, and a cosmopolitan lifestyle

According to the [Economic Development Board of Bahrain](https://www.bahrainedb.com/industries), FDI in 2023 exceeded $1.7 billion, with 2024 attracting even more foreign startups and investment. Digital transformation, fintech, logistics, and manufacturing continue to see robust growth.
