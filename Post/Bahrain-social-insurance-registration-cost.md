## Who Must Register for Social Insurance?
### For Bahraini Employees
All Bahraini nationals working in the private sector **must** be registered for social insurance. Contributions go toward pension, injury, and other benefits, helping protect local employees‚Äô future.

### For Expatriate Employees
Since Law No. 3 of 2022, private sector expats are required to be registered for workplace injury insurance (and unemployment in some cases). Pension isn‚Äôt included for expats, but **employers must still contribute a specific rate**.

### For Employers
