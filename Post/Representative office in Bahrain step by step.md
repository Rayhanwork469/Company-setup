## What Is a Representative Office in Bahrain? 🏢

A Representative Office is a type of legal entity that allows foreign companies to establish a presence in Bahrain **without engaging in commercial, revenue-generating activities**. It’s a liaison or contact office—an intermediary between your head office and the Bahraini market.

**Key Functions:**
- Market research & promotion
- Studying the business environment
- Liaising with local partners, regulators, or customers
- Preparing for potential future expansion

**What It Cannot Do:**
- Sell goods or services directly in Bahrain
- Sign contracts on behalf of the parent company (other than for office admin)
- Generate revenue
