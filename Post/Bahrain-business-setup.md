- **Zero corporate tax for most businesses**
- **No restrictions on capital or profit repatriation**
- **100% foreign ownership in many sectors** ([Learn more](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/))
- **Streamlined company registration via Sijilat portal**
- **Cutting-edge infrastructure in telecom, logistics, and finance**
- **Skilled, bilingual workforce**

From fintech startups to manufacturing, Bahrain has become a major magnet for regional and international investors. Plus, with the government’s Vision 2030 economic diversification plan, it’s easier than ever to launch and scale your business.

## Step-by-Step: How to Set Up a Business in Bahrain

### Choosing Your Activity & Company Name

First, select your business activity (e.g., trading, consultancy, industrial, fintech) and check foreign ownership rules. Then, reserve a unique business name via the [Sijilat portal](https://www.bahrain.com/).

**Tips:**
- Use the [CR Activity List](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/) to confirm permitted activities.
- Ensure the company name is available and meets MoICT criteria (no sensitive words; must reflect the business).

### Commercial Registration (CR)

*Alt text: Business owner submitting documents at Bahrain government office*

The commercial registration (CR) is your business’s legal license.  
**Documents Required:**
- Passport copies of shareholders
- NOC from employer (if resident)
- Lease contract or virtual office agreement
- Draft Memorandum of Association

Get step-by-step help from [CR registration experts](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/).

### Memorandum of Association (MOA)

A notarized MOA outlines shareholder roles, capital, and company scope. Templates and drafting support are available ([details here](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/)).  
**Pro tip:** For regulated activities (banking, medical, education), extra approvals apply.

### Local Sponsorship—Do You Need It?

Bahrain lets foreign investors own up to 100% of many businesses—no local partner needed.  
Sectors not open for 100% foreign ownership may require a Bahraini partner or sponsor, typically with a minority share ([learn more](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

### Opening a Corporate Bank Account
