### 1. Selecting Your Business Activity üîç

Start with your core business activity‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs trading, consulting, fintech, manufacturing, or logistics. Bahrain‚Äôs Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) maintains a detailed list (known as CR Activities).

**Pro Tip:** Not sure if your activity qualifies for 100% foreign ownership? Cross-check your intended CR activity with this [official database](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/).

### 2. Choosing the Legal Structure

- **WLL/LLC:** Great for SMEs and family businesses.
- **Single Person Company:** Best for solo founders.
- **Branch/Representative Office:** Ideal for existing foreign companies wishing to expand.
- **Partnerships:** Useful for multiple stakeholders.

Use this [comparison chart](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) to guide your choice.

### 3. Reserving a Company Name üìë

Pick an original, relevant business name. Submit your top choices via the MOICT online portal or through a service provider.
- The name must not infringe trademarks and should match Bahrain‚Äôs naming regulations.
- Name reservation is valid for 90 days.

### 4. Preparing the Memorandum of Association ‚úíÔ∏è

Every company type (except branches) requires a Memorandum of Association (MOA)‚Äîa foundational legal document.
- **Contents:** Activity, capital, shareholders, address, rules.
- **Expert assistance available:** [Learn more here](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/).

### 5. Securing a Business Address

You‚Äôll need a physical address in Bahrain (can be a virtual office for certain activities). Proof of address is required for CR approval.  
For affordable options, consult [local sponsorship services](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/).

### 6. Submitting the Commercial Registration (CR) Application üóÇÔ∏è

This is the crux of the whole process. The CR acts as your official business license.

- Typical documents: passport copies, lease agreement, MOA, company structure.
- Most CRs are issued within 5-7 working days.

- Requirements: CR, MOA, shareholder documents, and proof of address.
- Some banks require a minimum deposit.

See [how to open a Bahrain business account](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/).

### 8. Obtaining Licenses & Approvals

Depending on your sector, secure any special licenses (e.g., for financial services, healthcare, or retail).
- Retail, restaurants, and schools may require municipality or ministry approvals.

### 9. Visa & Labor Market Procedures üõÇ

- **Investor Visas:** Granted to company managers, directors, and owners ([visa services here](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/)).

Bahrain‚Äôs labor market authority streamlines most visa processes online.
