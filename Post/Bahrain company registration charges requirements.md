## Types of Companies You Can Register in Bahrain

Deciding on the right company structure is crucial—it impacts everything from your liability to how much paperwork you’ll handle. Here’s a breakdown:

### Limited Liability Company (WLL)

The most popular choice for foreign investors. Requires at least two shareholders. Offers **limited liability** (your assets are protected) and can engage in almost any commercial activity ([Learn more](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)).

### Single Person Company (SPC)

Going solo? An SPC allows one individual to own 100% of the business, with liability limited to capital invested. Quick, agile setup—ideal for consultants or startups ([SPC details](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/)).

### Foreign Branches

Already have a company outside Bahrain? Register a **branch office** to tap into local opportunities without starting from scratch. Must appoint a local agent ([Branch info](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/)).

### Free Zone Entities

Set up in a **free zone** for additional perks: zero customs duties, full foreign ownership, simplified import/export ([Free zone guide](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zone-in-bahrain/)).

#### Quick Comparison Table

| Company Type      | Foreign Ownership | Shareholders      | Min. Capital | Key Features                    |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| WLL               | Up to 100%       | 2 or more         | BD 20,000   | Most flexible, popular choice   |
| SPC               | 100%             | 1                 | BD 50       | Solo-friendly, simple           |
| Branch            | 100%             | N/A               | None        | Must have parent company abroad |
| Free Zone Entity  | 100%             | Varies            | Varies      | Incentives, sector-specific     |
