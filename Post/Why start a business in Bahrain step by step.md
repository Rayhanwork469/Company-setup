### Decide on Your Business Activity and Structure

Start by clarifying your commercial activity—retail, consultancy, tech, hospitality, manufacturing, or another. Find out if your activity is open for 100% foreign ownership ([see the full list](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/)) or if you’ll need a local sponsor ([sponsorship explained](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

**Pro Tip:** Many modern, professional, industrial, and trading activities are foreigner-friendly 📋.

### Choose a Legal Business Structure

Bahrain offers several legal forms:
- **With Limited Liability (WLL)**
- **Single Person Company (SPC)**  ([learn more](https://keylinkbh.com/single-person-company-in-bahrain/))
- **Public/Private Joint Stock Company**
- **Branch of a Foreign Company** ([guide](https://keylinkbh.com/foreign-company-branch-in-bahrain/))
- **Partnership**
- **Professional Firm**

Each type suits different investment goals, liabilities, and capital requirements ([full breakdown](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)).

| Structure                  | Min. Capital | 100% Foreign Ownership | Common Use Cases           |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| WLL (LLC)                  | BD 20,000    | Yes (for many activities) | Trading, services          |
| SPC                        | BD 50        | Yes                  | Sole founder businesses    |
| Branch                     | None         | Yes                  | Multinational expansion    |
| Joint Stock                | BD 100,000   | Conditional          | Larger enterprises         |

### Register Your Company Name and Obtain Commercial Registration (CR)

Every Bahraini business operates under a Commercial Registration (CR) issued by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism ([CR process](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)). Step-by-step:
1. Reserve your trade name online
2. Submit founder IDs, NOCs, and passport copies
3. Define business activities via the Sijilat portal
4. Pay official fees (around BD 50–150)
5. Receive your CR and start trading!

> **Did you know?** Registration can take less than a week for many SMEs.

### Prepare Documents: MOA and Other Essentials

You’ll need a Memorandum of Association (MOA), articles of incorporation, and sometimes a lease agreement. Legal translation is required for non-Arabic documents ([MOA explained](https://keylinkbh.com/memorandum-of-association-in-bahrain/)). Most companies use a local consultant for this process.

### Open a Corporate Bank Account

A local business bank account is mandatory ([banking setup](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/)). This step usually requires your CR, proof of address, shareholder info, and sometimes a business plan.

### Secure Visas and Hire Staff

Apply for work visas for owners, managers, and employees via Bahrain’s LMRA system. Hiring local staff is straightforward—foreigners can sponsor their own work/resident visas as shareholders ([visa info](https://keylinkbh.com/professional-visa-consultants-in-bahrain/)).

### Comply with Accounting, Tax & Local Laws

Maintain proper financial records and annual audits ([accounting partners](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)). VAT applies at 10%. There's no personal or corporate income tax for most activities—but industry-specific taxes may apply to oil/gas.
