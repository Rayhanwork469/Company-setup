*Alt text: Diverse professionals discussing commercial registration in Bahrain, Pexels*

The term **Commercial Registration (CR)** in Bahrain refers to the official process of establishing a legal entity authorized to conduct business activities within the Kingdom. The CR is essentially your business’s identity card — without it, you can’t operate legally, open a bank account, hire staff, or issue invoices.

- **Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC):** The MOIC is the governing body overseeing all commercial registrations. Its digital platform, [Sijilat](https://www.sijilat.bh/), streamlines the entire process.
- **Sijilat Portal:** This “one-stop shop” offers paperless, fast, and accessible registration, modifications, renewals, and more.

**Key Points:**
- All businesses (local or foreign-owned) must secure a CR before starting operations.
- The process has been digitalized, reducing paperwork and wait times.
- The CR applies to every business structure — from single-person companies to multi-national branches.

> Expert Insight:  
> “The CR process in Bahrain is among the Gulf’s most streamlined. The digital Sijilat portal puts everything at your fingertips, making it possible to register most businesses in under a week."
