Perfect for solo founders, freelancers, and consultants. An S.P.C is a limited liability company with a single shareholder—local or foreign.

- **Single owner:** 100% ownership possible
- **Easy management:** Direct control, lower setup barriers

## Local Sponsorship vs. Full Foreign Ownership

## Common Challenges and Solutions

Even though Bahrain’s setup process is among the region’s most streamlined, founders face a few hurdles:

- **Sector restrictions:** Not every activity is open to 100% foreign ownership (check approved lists).
- **CR licensing delays:** Missing paperwork or unclear activity descriptions slow approvals.
- **Bank account opening:** Enhanced due diligence may be required for offshore owners.
- **Local presence:** Some activities still need a physical office or local manager.

**Best practices:** Work with experienced [company incorporation specialists](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/) to avoid snags and accelerate licensing.
