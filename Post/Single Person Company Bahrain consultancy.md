## What is a Single Person Company in Bahrain? (Direct Answer)

A Single Person Company (SPC) in Bahrain is a legal entity owned and managed by a single individual. This structure gives the owner full control over operations while limiting personal liability to the company‚Äôs assets. Unlike a sole proprietorship, the SPC is a separate legal entity, offering greater protection and credibility. Foreigners can own 100% of an SPC in many sectors without requiring a local partner, subject to approved activity lists.

üîë **Quick Facts:**
- 100% control by a single shareholder
- Limited liability protection
- Suitable for residents and eligible foreigners
- Ideal for consultants, freelancers, and solo entrepreneurs
