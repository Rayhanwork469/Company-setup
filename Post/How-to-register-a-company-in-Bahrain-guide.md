![Image: Sijilat e-portal interface ‚Äì Alt: Screenshot of Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat company registration system](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181675/pexels-photo-1181675.jpeg)

### 1. Choose and Reserve Your Trade Name

Start with three name options via the [Sijilat portal](https://www.sijilat.bh/). The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) will approve one that meets legal criteria.

The CR is your legal permission to conduct business. Apply online through Sijilat, specifying:
- Chosen entity structure
- Business activities (select from [this list](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-cr-activities/))

Many entrepreneurs use [professional incorporation services](https://keylinkbh.com/company-incorporation-in-bahrain/) to avoid mistakes or delays.

### 4. MOA/AOA Notarization

Your Memorandum and Articles of Association define the company‚Äôs rules and ownership. These documents must be notarized and lodged with the MOICT.

### 5. Obtain Company Stamp, Tax, and Social Insurance Numbers

Following CR approval:
- Obtain a company stamp
- Register for VAT (if annual revenue exceeds BD 37,500)
- Register with the Social Insurance Organization (SIO) for employees

### 6. Open a Corporate Bank Account

Banks request the CR, MOA/AOA, and proof of office. Guidance: [How to open a business bank account in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/business-corporate-bank-account-in-bahrain/).
