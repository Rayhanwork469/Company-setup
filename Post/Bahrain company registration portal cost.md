Bahrain digitized its entire company registration process through the [Sijilat Portal](https://www.sijilat.bh), operated by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism. This online platform streamlines business setup, allowing applicants to:
- Check business name availability
- Select activity codes (CR activities)
- Upload supporting documents (e.g. passport, MOA)
- Pay government fees
- Track application status in real-time 🔍

### Key Steps on the Sijilat Portal

1. **Create an Account**: Enter applicant & shareholder details
2. **Name Approval**: Reserve your company name (BHD 25)
3. **Choose Business Activities**: Select from over 2000+ options
4. **Upload Documents**: ID, lease agreement, MOA
5. **Pay Registration Fees**: See table below for costs
6. **Receive Electronic CR**: Most businesses get a digital Commercial Registration within 3–5 days

> Expert tip: Use the Sijilat portal’s built-in calculator to estimate your total payable fees before checkout.

## Major Cost Factors in Bahrain Company Registration

### Government Fees Explained

Every business, big or small, faces a set of mandatory government charges. Here’s what you’ll need to budget for:

- **CR Issuance Fee:** This is the backbone of your registration – no CR, no business!
- **Annual Renewal Fee:** Keep your CR alive by paying your dues each year.
- **Municipality License:** Proves you have a valid commercial address.
- **Sector/Activity Fees:** Some sectors (e.g. finance, construction) require additional licensing.

> *Bonus: Many “foreigner-friendly” activities are now open to 100% foreign ownership. See the [Bahrain Foreign Ownership Guide](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/) for more.*

### Legal & Professional Fees

While the portal aims to be user-friendly, many applicants hire consultants or lawyers for:
- Drafting a Memorandum of Association (MOA)
- Navigating foreign ownership rules
- Liaising with ministries for sectoral approvals

**Expect to pay BHD 200–2,000 for full legal support**, depending on complexity.

### Hidden and Optional Costs

- **Office Lease:** Physical address required. Virtual offices accepted for some CR types.
- **Bank Account Opening:** Most banks ask for a minimum deposit (BHD 1,000–5,000).
- **Visa Expenses:** Need a manager or employee visa? Budget for application and labor fees.
- **Accountancy:** Annual bookkeeping and tax submissions are mandatory ([see accounting services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)).

- Over 99% of commercial activities permit *100% foreign ownership*—no local sponsor needed!
- Sectors like retail, hospitality, fintech, and consulting are all foreigner-friendly.

**Does foreign ownership increase costs?**

- Provide extra documentation (e.g. overseas ID)
- Appoint a resident manager
- Budget for specialist legal help
