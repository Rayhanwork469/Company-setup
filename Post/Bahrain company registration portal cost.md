Bahrain digitized its entire company registration process through the [Sijilat Portal](https://www.sijilat.bh), operated by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism. This online platform streamlines business setup, allowing applicants to:
- Check business name availability
- Select activity codes (CR activities)
- Upload supporting documents (e.g. passport, MOA)
- Pay government fees
- Track application status in real-time üîç

### Key Steps on the Sijilat Portal

1. **Create an Account**: Enter applicant & shareholder details
2. **Name Approval**: Reserve your company name (BHD 25)
3. **Choose Business Activities**: Select from over 2000+ options
4. **Upload Documents**: ID, lease agreement, MOA
5. **Pay Registration Fees**: See table below for costs
6. **Receive Electronic CR**: Most businesses get a digital Commercial Registration within 3‚Äì5 days

> Expert tip: Use the Sijilat portal‚Äôs built-in calculator to estimate your total payable fees before checkout.

## Major Cost Factors in Bahrain Company Registration

### Government Fees Explained

Every business, big or small, faces a set of mandatory government charges. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need to budget for:

- **CR Issuance Fee:** This is the backbone of your registration ‚Äì no CR, no business!
- **Annual Renewal Fee:** Keep your CR alive by paying your dues each year.
- **Municipality License:** Proves you have a valid commercial address.
- **Sector/Activity Fees:** Some sectors (e.g. finance, construction) require additional licensing.

> *Bonus: Many ‚Äúforeigner-friendly‚Äù activities are now open to 100% foreign ownership. See the [Bahrain Foreign Ownership Guide](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/) for more.*

### Legal & Professional Fees

While the portal aims to be user-friendly, many applicants hire consultants or lawyers for:
- Drafting a Memorandum of Association (MOA)
- Navigating foreign ownership rules
- Liaising with ministries for sectoral approvals

**Expect to pay BHD 200‚Äì2,000 for full legal support**, depending on complexity.
