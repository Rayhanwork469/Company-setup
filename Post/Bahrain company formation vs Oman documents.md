- **Oman** still requires Omani partners or sponsors in several restricted activities (though less so than in the past).

### 4. Speed & Transparency

- **Bahrain** is lauded for quick processing (often under 10 days) and fee transparency.

## Featured Snippet: Most Common Bahrain & Oman Document Questions

**Q: What documents do I need to start a company in Bahrain compared to Oman in 2025?**

**A:**  
To open a company in Bahrain, you’ll need passport and address proof for all owners, a Memorandum of Association, a trade name reservation, and a commercial registration (CR) via the Sijilat portal—most of which can be handled digitally. Oman also requires passport and address proof, but mandates notarized documents, a capital deposit, evidence of office space, and sector permissions—processing is usually more manual and document-heavy. In both countries, extra paperwork applies for regulated sectors or branch offices.
