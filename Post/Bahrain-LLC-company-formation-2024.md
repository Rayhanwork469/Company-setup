## What Is an LLC in Bahrain? Understanding the Basics

An LLC (Limited Liability Company) in Bahrain is the most common and flexible corporate structure for foreign and local investors. It blends the benefits of limited liability protection with fewer compliance burdens than many other legal forms.

### Key Features of a Bahrain LLC:
- **Separate legal entity:** The company can enter contracts, own assets, and sue or be sued independently of its shareholders.
- **Limited liability:** Shareholders’ responsibility is limited to their share capital.
- **Minimum shareholders:** At least two shareholders are required; however, **single-person companies** are now also permissible under Bahrain’s evolving laws.
- **Capital requirement:** There is no minimum capital as per the latest rules, making entry easier for startups.
- **Foreign ownership:** Up to 100% foreign ownership is permitted in many sectors (see details on [foreign ownership in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)).

Bahrain LLCs are suitable for most commercial activities, including trading, consulting, and manufacturing within the kingdom. However, some activities may require special licenses or local sponsorship ([local sponsorship details](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).
